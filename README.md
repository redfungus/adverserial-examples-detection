# The histogram method for adversarial example detection in neural-network-based text classification

This Repo contains the implementation of a adverserial example classifier using the histogram method which was done as a project for the Scalable Machine Learning course at KTH.  
The full report of the project can be seen in `The histogram method for adversarial example detection in neural-network-based text classification.pdf`.
